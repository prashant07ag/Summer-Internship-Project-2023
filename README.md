Tools Used in this projects are: 
Flutter SDK: Flutter SDK is the primary tool for developing cross-platform mobile applications. It provides a comprehensive set of development tools, frameworks, and libraries for building mobile apps that can run on both iOS and Android platforms.
Android Studio: A fully-featured IDE specifically designed for Android app development, which also includes robust Flutter support.
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) Libraries: To define and train CNN models, you'll need specialized libraries within the deep learning framework you choose. TensorFlow and PyTorch provide dedicated libraries for building and training CNN models, such as Keras.
TensorFlow Lite: TensorFlow Lite is a lightweight framework for deploying machine learning models on mobile and embedded devices.
Version Control System: Using a version control system, such as Git, is crucial for maintaining code integrity, managing changes, and collaborating with others effectively.
Deployment Platforms: To distribute your mobile application to users, you'll need accounts on relevant deployment platforms, such as the App Store (for iOS) and Google Play Store (for Android).
Testing Tools: Various testing tools and frameworks are available for testing the functionality, performance, and user experience of your mobile application. These include Flutter's built-in testing framework, unit testing frameworks (e.g., Mockito), and automation tools (e.g., Flutter Driver or Appium) for UI testing
